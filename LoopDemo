#Loops are structures used to repeat sections of code.
#They are useful if you have to do the same thing more than once
#or you can establish a pattern

#Example 1
print("0")
print("1")
print("2")
print("3")
print("4")

#This is a counted loop. I want you to think about 
#count, check, change
#i = 0, 0 < 5, TRUE - RUN LOOP

for i in range(7,326,1)
	print(i)

print("MOVING ON")
